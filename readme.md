# Platform Movement
This is a personal project where I experiment with ways to implement movement
and collision for a sidescrolling platformer. This project is likely to change
shape several times and may occasionally resemble a game.

This is written in JS because it's an easy environment to experiment in.

## Current Features
- Basic movement.
  - Running left and right.
  - Jumping with Yoshi's Island-style hovering.
